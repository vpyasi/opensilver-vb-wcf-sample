OpenSilver vb wcf sample
In the solution, we have the following five projects-
1) OpenSilverApplication
2) OpenSilverApplication.Browser
3) OpenSilverApplication.Simulator
4) OpenSilverServiceProxy
5) WCFService
Â 
The first three are essential to OpenSilver, and the last two are the WCF service (.Net Framework 4.7.2) and its Service-proxy-project (OpenSilver class library in C#, because C# has better tooling support for old WCF services, here we only have auto-generated code).
